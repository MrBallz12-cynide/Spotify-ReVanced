# The AS17 Protocol – Patching Spotify with ReVanced (The Clean, Reliable Way)

> **Nickname:** The AS17 Protocol  
> **Purpose:** A rock-solid method to patch the official Spotify app using ReVanced Manager without relying on unstable microG or sketchy pre-modded APKs. This method emphasizes reliability, compatibility, and ease of use.

---

## 🚀 Why This Method?

The "standard" method often suggested by forums and some AI models includes installing microG and downloading random modded Spotify APKs. That method **fails frequently**, causes weird logins, and breaks updates.

**The AS17 Protocol** is different. It uses the official Spotify app from the Play Store itself, ensuring:

- ✅ Higher compatibility  
- ✅ Fewer errors  
- ✅ Trustworthy source  
- ✅ Clean, repeatable steps

## 🧰 What You Need

- ReVanced Manager (latest version)  
- Spotify (installed via Google Play Store)  
- [ML Manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.mememoo.mlmanager) *(or any APK extractor like AntiSplit M)*  
- AntiSplit M (recommended) or ML Manager — can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/) *(search for AntiSplit M)*  
- A brain (optional, but recommended)

## 🛠 Step-by-Step: The AS17 Protocol

### 1. **Install Spotify from the Play Store**
- Go to Play Store  
- Search "Spotify"  
- Install it normally  
- Don’t need to open it  

### 2. **Extract the APK using ML Manager or AntiSplit M**
- Open AntiSplit M or your APK extractor  
- Tap on Spotify  
- Choose "select from installed Apps"  
- Save the extracted `.apk` to your internal storage  

### 3. **Open ReVanced Manager**
- Tap on **"Patch an APK"**  
- Locate the extracted `spotify.apk`  
- Choose the patches you want (skip microG patch!)  

### 4. **Patch the APK**
- Let ReVanced do its thing  
- Wait for the process to complete  

### 5. **Uninstall the original Spotify**
- Log out if logged in  
- Uninstall the Play Store version  

### 6. **Install the patched Spotify APK**
- Locate the patched APK in ReVanced’s output folder  
- Install it manually  
- Open Spotify, log in, and enjoy

> **Important (Final Step):**  
> To make sure your patched Spotify actually stays patched and doesn’t randomly update itself into oblivion, go to the Spotify page in the Play Store, click the **overflow menu** (three vertical dots on the top right), and **uncheck “Enable auto-update.”**  
> Because if you don’t, Spotify will auto-update, nuke your patched app, and force you to repeat the whole AS17 Protocol again. Ain’t nobody got time for that.  
>
> iPhone users? Suck my dih. This method is Android-only :) Cry different. 😎
